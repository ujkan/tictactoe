a couple of notes
    * eval function should be implemented in minimax, not Board
    * find better board representation (perhaps string of length 9), easier to manipulate
    * many inefficiencies! the deepcopy probably causes issues
        -> find a way for tree children nodes to inherit the board more smoothly
        -> fix gametree
